# Hilo
Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. 100 points are won if the player guess correct or 75 points are lost if the player's guess is wrong. The player starts each game with 300 points. When the player reaches 0 points or chooses not to play again the game is over. 

## Getting Started

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
